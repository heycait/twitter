twitter client in rails


We would like you to build a really basic Twitter client all in rails. The app should include the following functionality:
Allow a user to authenticate via Twitter. Feel free to use the Twitter framework as much as you want
Display a user's home_timeline, updating live whenever new tweets come in
Allow the user to post a new tweet
				
From a technological perspective, we'd also like to see the following:
Comment your code well
Make sure to use MVC properly
Our goal is simply to have a usable app, so don't worry about making a pretty UI or finessing the UX too much. For example, no need to include Twitter profile pictures next to tweets, no need to support both too many browsers, etc. 
We really are interested mostly in the code and not the presentation. 
Also, feel free to incorporate open source software into your app (in fact, we encourage you to do so!).
